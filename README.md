# Arduino Due Flash library

This library allows Flash memory self-programming: flash memory can be
used to store non volatile data (and can partly replace missing EEPROM
in the SAM3X CPU).

# Warning

This library is in alpha-stage.    

The API is not stable and will be changed in the coming revisions without notice.
